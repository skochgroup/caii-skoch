                          <h2>S Ramadorai</h2>
                          <p class="text-start">S Ramadorai has been in public service since February 2011 and is currently the Chairman of National Skill Development Agency (NSDA) in the rank of a Cabinet Minister. The NSDA is an autonomous body, which coordinates and harmonises the skill development efforts of the Government and the private sector to achieve the skilling targets of the nation. He is also Chairman of the National Skill Development Corporation (NSDC), a Public Private Partnership arm of the Government of India for creating large, for-profit vocational institutions.</p>
                          <p class="text-start">He recently retired as Vice-Chairman of Tata Consultancy Services Ltd, a company he was associated with, for 42 years. He took charge as CEO in 1996 when the company’s revenues were at $155 million and since then led the company through some of its most exciting phases, including its going public in 2004. In October 2009, he completed his tenure as CEO, leaving a $6 billion global IT services company to his successor to lead. He was then appointed Vice-Chairman of TCS. The company’s revenue was recorded at $13.4 billion for the year ended March 31, 2014.</p>
                          <p class="text-start">Mr. Ramadorai is also the Chairman of the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE Limited) and AirAsia (India) Pvt Ltd. He continues to be an Independent Director on the Boards of Hindustan Unilever Limited, Asian Paints Limited, Piramal Enterprises Limited.</p>
                          <p class="text-start">He was awarded the Padma Bhushan (India’s third highest civilian honour) in January 2006. In April 2009, he was awarded the CBE (Commander of the Order of the British Empire) by Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II for his contribution to the growth of Indo-British economic relations.</p>
                          <p class="text-start">His academic credentials include a Bachelor’s degree in Physics from Delhi University, a Bachelor of Engineering degree in Electronics and Telecommunications from the Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore and a Masters degree in Computer Science from the University of California – UCLA (USA). In 1993, Ramadorai attended the Sloan School of Management’s highly acclaimed Senior Executive Development Programme.</p>
                          <p class="text-start">Ramadorai has actively participated in India’s IT journey from its inception in 1960’s to a mature industry today. Ramadorai has captured this exciting journey in a wonderfully personalised book titled ‘The TCS Story…and beyond’ which was published in 2011 and remained on top of the charts for several months.</p>
                          <p class="text-start">Among his many interests, Ramadorai is also passionate about photography and Indian classical music.</p>
